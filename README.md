# Welcome to The Fifa Dataset Dashboard. #

My project is a website that has been based on a Fifa dataset with the best players in the world repersenting it. 
I have created a scroll page Dashboard included with assets such as piechart and a barchart. My primary target
is to create charts with information on avaliablity of viewing. 


[This is the link to the live page](https://data-dashboard-noellebrowne.c9users.io/index.html).

# UX #

This is a Dashboard created for users, my primary target is to achieve the goal of being able view the piechart's and barchart of this data that is represented throught those charts.

My Dashboard will be a 4 chart dashboard created with two pie charts, one bar chart, a line chart, another composite chart and stacked chart.  These page will allow me to achieve my goals.

* As a user type, I would like to create a dashboard to view a piechart. 
* As a user type, I would like to create a chart to show the nationality of the football players for users to views on my dashboard. 
* As a user type, I would like to achieve a goal of creating a linechart for users to access on my dashboard. 


My goal was to make information accessible on the site and user friendly, as shown through the charts I have created.

# Wire frames I designed ### 

Here I have included three wire frames from where I based the developement of my website. 
There is a rough chart wireframe i drew first, then a second wireframe its a rough sketch of a barchart,linechart,composite chart and a stacked barchart and the last one is the third chart drawing which was an idea what my website would look like.
They are in the assets folder.

My design process for me was to draw my wireframes and add them to my project.

* [First rough chart wireframe](https://github.com/noellebrowne/data-dashboard/blob/master/assets/IMG_5466-1.jpg "Wireframe 1 - rough chart drawing")
* [second rough chart wireframe](https://github.com/noellebrowne/data-dashboard/blob/master/assets/IMG_5469.jpg "Wireframe 2 - first chart drawing")
* [third chart drawing](https://github.com/noellebrowne/data-dashboard/blob/master/assets/IMG_5467-1.jpg "Wireframe 3 - second chart drawing")

# Planning of my website: #

When I decided to plan my website, I looked at artists that I thought would help me and give me an idea of a layout of what should be included in my page for design of the charts, colour scheme of the charts,and the flow of my page.
When I understood what needed to be the base of my dashboard such as a piechart, barchart, a line chart, another composite chart and stacked chart. 

I decided that I would draw my wire frames with a pen and paper for each of my charts. I made a folder with my assets which were photos of my wireframes.

I researched diffrent type of charts and dashboards to look at diffrent colour schemes I could use as well as diffrent charts and there size and placement on the page.Most charts 
are well structured and simple but easy to use and find your way around so I wanted mine to be user friendly.

# Deployment of my project #

My Deployment was done by opening a terminal and then by using the code git status first followed git add (I put in my file or image) git commit -m "message on what the update was"
and the git push to the master branch followed by my username and password.
 
I deployed my page from github through github pages. I went to settings in my github repository and scrolled down to Github pages title and changed my source from disabled
to master branch and clicked save. now my website has been deployed.


# Testing process for my project #


I tested my project everytime I included an item such as a new chart to make sure that it was loading and running correctly. 
I tested diffrent charts on each section to see what would work best with my dataset that I had chosen to create the charts with.
When I created my piechart to my graph.js at first it didnt work as I never closed it with a closing tag but I recorrected this error, it worked straight away and it loaded the data that was to load. 
All the rest of my charts worked after abit of tweaking of missing brackets for the linechart and I had to figure out a way to pass the â‚¬ sign as it wouldnt run so that look time but it worked out which I was pleased with.
I used inspect to test my charts through google chrome for errors as this worked most effective for me.
I also asked someone on slack to look at it for there advice.
